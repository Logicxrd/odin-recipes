    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      One of the bests ways to cook and eat shrimp is in a luscious creamy sauce
      with pasta! Some of my favorites are creamy mozzarella shrimp pasta and
      spicy shrimp pasta with tomato cream sauce. And, don't forget mushrooms -
      they go amazingly well with shrimp, as in this scrumptious creamy shrimp
      pasta in a flavorful homemade sauce with mushrooms!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch dried basil, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch paprika, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
      <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
      <li>¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>½ (16 ounce) package dry fettuccine pasta</li>
      <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Immediately add shrimp and garlic; cook until shrimp is pink, 3 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle salt, basil, and paprika over shrimp. Cook and stir for 1 minute more, leaving shrimp slightly undercooked to finish cooking in the sauce.</p></li>
        <li><p>Remove shrimp mixture from the skillet. Add mushrooms to the same skillet. Cook and stir, seasoning with salt, until juicy, about 5 minutes. Add the shrimp; immediately pour in half-and-half, mozzarella cheese, and Parmesan cheese. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, constantly stirring, until cheese melts, 5 to 8 minutes. Cover with a lid and remove from heat.</p></li>
        <li><p>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook fettuccine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. If cream sauce is too thick, add some pasta water in small amounts. Drain pasta and rinse with cold water. Add to the cream sauce.</p></li>
