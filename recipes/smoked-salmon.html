    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 cups brown sugar, divided</li>
      <li>1 cup kosher salt</li>
      <li>3 pounds salmon fillets</li>
      <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
      <li>
        2 (12 fluid ounce) cans or bottles cola flavored carbonated beverage
      </li>
      <li>3 cups wood chips, soaked</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix 1 cup brown sugar and kosher salt together in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the brown sugar mixture in the bottom of a 9-inch baking pan. Arrange 2 to 3 salmon fillets on top; cover with some of the brown sugar mixture. Repeat layers until all the salmon fillets are coated. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat a smoker to 195 degrees F (91 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions</li>
        <li>Rinse brown sugar mixture off salmon fillets. Brush fillets lightly with honey and sprinkle remaining 1/2 cup brown sugar on top.</li>
        <li>Pour cola-flavored beverage into the smoker's water pan; add water to within 1 inch of the top. Place half of the wood chips around the perimeter of the hot charcoal. Place salmon on the cooking racks.</li>
        <li>Cook salmon, adding more wood chips if needed, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 2 hours. Cool before serving, at least 15 minutes.</li>
