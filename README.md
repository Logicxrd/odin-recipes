# odin-recipes

Creating a website with unique food recipes on each page. The website will have
a home page and 3 other pages known as 'recipe pages' giving a brief description
of the dish along with a list of ingredients steps to make it.

The goal of the project is to test learned HTML skills such as:
-creating a HTML boilerplate
-linking HTML pages
-creating ordered and unordered lists
- using relative and absolute addressing to add an image
- using various tags
